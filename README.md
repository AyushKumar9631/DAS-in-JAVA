Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my DSA practice and implementations in Java.
I am studying from Kunal Kushwahaâ€™s DSA in Java YouTube lectures and documenting my progress here.

#Contents

Implementations of data structures (arrays, linked list, stack, queue, trees, graphs, etc.)
Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, greedy, etc.)
Practice problems with solutions

#Goal

To build a strong foundation in DSA, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare for coding interviews.
